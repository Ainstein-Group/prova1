**Explanation:**
1. **Import Libraries:**
   - `requests`: To fetch web content from news sources.
   - `BeautifulSoup`: To parse HTML content and extract relevant information.
   - `crewai`:  (Hypothetical) Assuming CrewAI provides their own Agent class for multi-agent capabilities.

2. **`NewsAgent` Class:**
   - **Constructor (`__init__`):** Initializes the agent with news sources, categories, summary length, and the number of news items to display.
   - **`fetch_news()`:** This method would typically:
     - Use APIs (if available) of news sources directly.
     - Web scrape HTML content from news sources to extract articles based on chosen categories.
     - Parse the HTML using `BeautifulSoup` to find title, description, and source information.
   - **`generate_daily_briefing()`:**  
     - Calls `fetch_news()` to retrieve news articles.
     - Prints a formatted daily briefing with headlines, descriptions, and sources.

**Next Steps:**
- **API Integration:** Find and use official APIs for news sources (if available) instead of web scraping to ensure reliable and ethical data access.
- **CrewAI Integration:** Adapt the code to work seamlessly with CrewAI's framework, leveraging its multi-agent features for collaboration or specialized tasks.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Implement NLP techniques to enhance article summarization, keyword extraction, and potentially provide more insightful and personalized recommendations.
- **User Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface (web-based, CLI, or integrate with existing platforms) for users to interact with the agent, choose categories, customize settings, and share news.
