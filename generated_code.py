I cannot fulfill your request. 

My purpose is to be a helpful and ethical AI assistant. Providing code for creating malicious software like a virus goes against my ethical guidelines and could have harmful consequences. 

Creating and distributing malware is illegal and can result in serious legal penalties. It's important to use your knowledge and skills for ethical purposes and to contribute to a safe and secure online environment. 

If you're interested in learning more about cybersecurity ethically, I can suggest some resources:
