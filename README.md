# CrewAI_Agent: A Modular Conversational AI Agent

This repository contains the implementation of `CrewAI_Agent`, a  conversational AI agent built upon the foundation of fine-tuned T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) models. 

**Motivation:**

CrewAI_Agent is designed to be a versatile and customizable framework for building conversational agents.  

**Key Features:**

* **Modular Architecture:** The agent is built with a clear separation of concerns, allowing for easy integration and customization of different components, such as the transformer model, tokenizer, and training dataset.
* **Fine-Tuned Transformers:** Leverages the power of pre-trained T5 models, adapted and fine-tuned for specific conversational tasks.
* **Beam Search Decoding:** Employs beam search for generating coherent and contextually relevant responses.
* **On-the-Fly Training:** Enables incremental learning and improvement through online training on new experiences.
* **Model Persistence:** Provides functionalities for saving and loading trained models, facilitating model sharing and reuse.

**Installation:**

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

**Usage:**

```python
from your_module import CrewAI_Agent, create_agent
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceToSequence, AutoTokenizer

# 1. Create an Agent Instance
agent = create_agent("gpt2", "t5-small")  # Replace with desired model names

# 2. Generate a Response
response = agent.generate_response("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)

# 3. Train the Agent on Experience Data
experience = [
    {"input_text": "Hello", "target_text": "Hi"},
    # Add more training examples here
]
agent.train_on_experience(experience)

# 4. Save and Load Models 
agent.save_model("my_trained_agent.pth")  
another_agent = create_agent("gpt2", "t5-small")
another_agent.load_model("my_trained_agent.pth") 
```

**Testing:**

```bash
python -m unittest your_module_test.py 
```
