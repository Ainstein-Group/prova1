# NewsAgent

This project provides a basic framework for retrieving and summarizing news articles from various sources. 

## Installation

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 crewai 
```

## Usage

The `NewsAgent` class can be instantiated with a list of news sources, categories of interest, the desired length of article summaries, and the number of news items to retrieve. 

```python
agent = NewsAgent(news_source=["bbc.com", "nytimes.com"], categories=["technology", "politics"], summary_length=150, num_news=5)
agent.generate_daily_briefing() 
```

This will fetch the latest news articles from BBC and NYT, focusing on technology and politics, generate summaries for each article, and display them in a user-friendly format.

## Example

```python
from NEWS_AGENT import NewsAgent
# Remember to replace with your actual agent instance

agent = NewsAgent(news_source=["bbc.com"], categories=["politics"], summary_length=200, num_news=3)
agent.generate_daily_briefing() 
```

## Limitations

This project currently uses basic web scraping techniques for retrieving news articles. This method may not be reliable or scalable in the long term and raises ethical considerations.

For optimal performance and ethical data access, it is highly recommended to use official APIs provided by news sources whenever available.
