# Sustainable Home Agent

This project implements a simple Sustainable Home Agent using the crewAI framework. The agent aims to provide personalized recommendations for sustainable living based on user data and environmental metrics.

## Agent Functionality

The `SustainableHomeAgent` class defines the agent's behavior:

* **Initialization:**
    * Takes the API key and model name as input during initialization.
    * Initializes an empty dictionary `user_data` to store user-specific information.
    * Initializes an empty list `recommendations` to store the agent's suggestions.

* **`set_user_data(self, user_data)`:**
    * Sets the user data for the agent.

* **`generate_recommendations(self)`:**
    * This method is intended to contain the logic for generating recommendations based on the user data and environmental metrics. Currently, it is a placeholder.

* **`get_recommendations(self)`:**
    * Returns the list of recommendations generated by the agent.

## API Endpoint

A Flask API endpoint `/train` is provided to train the agent with user data.

* **Request:**
    * Accepts a POST request with JSON payload containing user data.
    * Data should be structured as a dictionary (e.g., `{"user": "test", "data": "sample"}`).

* **Response:**
    * Returns a JSON response with the message "Agent trained successfully" if the training is successful.

## Testing

The project includes unit tests using the `unittest` framework that cover:

* Agent initialization and attribute values.
* The `set_user_data` method functionality.
* The `generate_recommendations` and `get_recommendations` methods.

## Running the Agent

1. Make sure you have `crewAI` and `flask` installed (`pip install crewAI flask`).
2. Replace `"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"` with your actual crewAI API key.

3. Run the script from the command line: `python your_script_name.py`.

This will start the Flask development server and make the `/train` endpoint accessible.

## Further Development

This project provides a basic framework for a Sustainable Home Agent. To make it more functional, you would need to:

* Implement the `generate_recommendations` method to utilize the user data and environmental metrics to generate relevant and actionable recommendations.
* Consider incorporating real-time environmental data feeds to provide more dynamic and context-aware suggestions.
* Implement additional features such as user profiling, feedback mechanisms, and personalized learning.
