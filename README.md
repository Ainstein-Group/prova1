# GreenHome Assistant

GreenHome Assistant is a Python tool designed to help you analyze your energy consumption, suggest sustainability improvements, and estimate associated costs and potential government incentives.

## Overview

GreenHome Assistant utilizes several classes to perform the following tasks:

* **EnergyAnalyst:** Analyzes your energy consumption data to calculate key metrics such as mean, total, and peak consumption.
* **SustainabilityAdvisor:** Provides a list of recommended sustainability interventions to reduce your energy footprint.
* **CostEstimator:** Estimates the costs of the recommended interventions and outlines potential return on investment based on the provided benefits.
* **GovernmentProgramChecker:**  Checks for available government programs and incentives that may apply to your chosen interventions.
* **main Function:** Orchestrates the entire process, combining the results of each class to provide a comprehensive sustainability plan for your home.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:** 
    Make sure you have NumPy installed. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

2. **Run the Code:**
    Save the Python code in a file named `greenhome_assistant.py` (or any name of your choice) and run it from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python greenhome_assistant.py
    ```

3. **Provide Data:**
    The program will prompt you to input your energy consumption data. This can be a list or array of energy usage values (e.g., daily, monthly).


## Explanation

The code works by first collecting your energy consumption data. It then uses the `EnergyAnalyst` class to calculate key metrics about your consumption patterns.

Based on your consumption data, the `SustainabilityAdvisor` suggests a range of interventions to improve your home's energy efficiency. These interventions include:

* **Solar Panels:** Installing solar panels to generate renewable energy.  
* **Thermal Insulation:** Adding insulation to walls, attics, and floors to reduce heat loss.
* **LED Lighting:** Replacing traditional lighting with energy-efficient LED bulbs.

The `CostEstimator` then evaluates the cost of each suggested intervention, including both upfront installation costs and potential long-term savings on energy bills.

Finally, the `GovernmentProgramChecker` investigates whether any government programs or incentives are available to help offset the costs of implementing these suggestions.

## Customization

You can customize the suggested interventions, cost estimates, and incentive checks by modifying the corresponding classes (e.g., `SustainabilityAdvisor`, `CostEstimator`, `GovernmentProgramChecker`).
