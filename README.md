# Water Measurer

This project provides a simple Python implementation of a water measurer using two vases with different capacities. 

## Description

The water measurer simulates the process of measuring a specific volume of water (in this case, 3 liters) using two vases: a larger vase with a capacity of 5 liters and a smaller vase with a capacity of 3 liters. It demonstrates a classic algorithm for measuring arbitrary volumes using only these two vases.

## Requirements and Dependencies

* Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-measurer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd water-measurer`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

```python
from your_module import WaterMeasurer  # Replace 'your_module' with the actual module name

measurer = WaterMeasurer()
operations = measurer.measure()

print("Operations:")
for operation in operations:
    print(operation)

print(f"Final water level in vase 3: {measurer.vase3.get_water()} liters")
print(f"Final water level in vase 5: {measurer.vase5.get_water()} liters")
```

**Explanation:**

* Create an instance of `WaterMeasurer`.
* Call the `measure()` method to perform the measurement process.
* The method returns a list of strings describing the steps taken to measure the water.
* The final water levels in both vases are printed.

## Architecture

The project consists of two main classes:

* **`Vase`**: Represents a vase with a specific capacity and a current water level.
* **`WaterMeasurer`**: Manages the two vases and implements the measurement algorithm.

## API Reference

**`Vase` Class:**

* **`__init__(self, capacity: int)`**: Initializes a new vase with the given capacity.
* **`fill(self)`**: Fills the vase to its maximum capacity.
* **`empty(self)`**: Empties the vase.
* **`transfer(self, amount: int)`**: Transfers the given amount of water from the vase to another vase.
* **`get_water(self) -> int`**: Returns the current water level in the vase.

**`WaterMeasurer` Class:**

* **`__init__(self)`**: Initializes a new `WaterMeasurer` with two vases: one with a capacity of 5 liters and one with a capacity of 3 liters.
* **`measure(self) -> List[str]`**: Performs the water measurement process and returns a list of strings describing the steps taken.

## Testing

The project includes unit tests using the `pytest` framework. To run the tests, execute the following command in the project directory:

```bash
pytest
```
