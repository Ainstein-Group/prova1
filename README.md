# GreenHomePlanner: Your Sustainable Home Design Assistant

**GreenHomePlanner** is a Python tool designed to help homeowners analyze their energy consumption, suggest sustainable interventions, and estimate the costs and benefits of these interventions. 

## Description

This project aims to empower homeowners to make informed decisions about improving the energy efficiency of their homes. It provides a framework for analyzing existing energy consumption data, identifying potential areas for improvement, and evaluating the financial and environmental impact of various sustainable solutions.

## Requirements and Dependencies

* **Python 3.7 or higher**
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library ([https://pandas.pydata.org/](https://pandas.pydata.org/))
* **NumPy:** Numerical computing library ([https://numpy.org/](https://numpy.org/))
* **typing:** Type hinting for better code readability and maintainability

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/GreenHomePlanner.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd GreenHomePlanner`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

**1. Data Preparation:**

* Ensure you have energy consumption data in a CSV file named "energy_consumption_data.csv". 
* The CSV should have a column named "data" containing your energy consumption values.

**2. Running the Planner:**

* Modify the `house_info` and `user_preferences` dictionaries in `main.py` to match your specific house details and desired intervention type.

* Run the script: `python main.py`

**Example:**

```python
# main.py

energy_consumption_data = pd.read_csv("energy_consumption_data.csv")
house_info = {"house_size": 150, "house_type": "single_family"}
user_preferences = {"budget": 15000, "intervention_type": "solar_panels"}

green_home_planner = GreenHomePlanner(energy_consumption_data, house_info, user_preferences)
green_home_planner.run()
```

This will analyze your energy consumption data, suggest suitable sustainable interventions, estimate their costs and benefits, and check for available government incentives.

## Architecture

The GreenHomePlanner follows a modular architecture:

* **`GreenHomePlanner` Class:**
    *  Manages the overall workflow, including data loading, analysis, intervention suggestion, cost-benefit estimation, and government incentive checks.
* **`analyze_energy_consumption()` Method:**
    *  Processes energy consumption data to identify patterns and potential areas for improvement.
* **`suggest_sustainable_interventions()` Method:**
    *  Recommends sustainable interventions based on the analyzed data and user preferences.
* **`estimate_costs_and_benefits()` Method:**
    *  Calculates the estimated costs and benefits of each suggested intervention.
* **`check_government_incentives()` Method:**
    *  Determines if any government incentives are available for the suggested interventions.

## API Reference

**`GreenHomePlanner` Class**

* **`__init__(self, energy_consumption_data: pd.DataFrame, house_info: Dict[str, Any], user_preferences: Dict[str, Any])`:**
    *  Initializes the GreenHomePlanner object with energy consumption data, house information, and user preferences.
* **`analyze_energy_consumption(self) -> pd.DataFrame`:**
    *  Analyzes energy consumption data to identify patterns and potential areas for improvement.
* **`suggest_sustainable_interventions(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`:**
    *  Suggests sustainable interventions based on the analyzed data and user preferences.
* **`estimate_costs_and_benefits(self, intervention: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`:**
    *  Estimates the costs and benefits of a given intervention.
* **`check_government_incentives(self, intervention: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`:**
    *  Checks for available government incentives for a given intervention.

* **`run(self) -> None`:**
    *  Executes the entire workflow, including data analysis, intervention suggestion, cost-benefit estimation, and incentive checking.
